1. In iTerm2, open `Preferences > Profiles > Colors > Color Presets… > Import…` and select your desired `.itermcolors` file from `extras/iterm/themes/dark/` or `extras/iterm/themes/light/<1-5>/`.
2. Choose the imported preset from the same menu to apply it.

> [!Tip]
> Add both the dark and light variants for automatic switching if you use macOS Appearance-based profiles.
