# Kitty Setup

1. Create `~/.config/kitty/themes`
2. Download your desired theme file(s) into the `themes` directory
3. From here, you have two options:

- **Use the Kitten Themes**:
  - In your terminal, enter `kitten themes` and search via `/` for `oasis`
  - Select your desired theme and follow the prompts
  - Refer to [the official guide](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/themes/) for any questions
- **Manual:**
  - Include the theme in `~/.config/kitty/kitty.conf`.
  - _Ex: `include themes/oasis_lagoon.conf`_

> [!TIP]
> Use the `kitten themes` for automatic light/dark mode based on your OS settings and instant preview/switching.
