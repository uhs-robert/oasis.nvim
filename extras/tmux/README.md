# Tmux Setup

The [Tmux theme is actually it's own standalone plugin](https://github.com/uhs-robert/tmux-oasis).

Click the link above and follow the instructions for full Tmux integration.

- The plugin includes a status line which displays the current Tmux Mode (just like in NeoVim!)

> [!NOTE]
> The theme files in this folder are color palettes that are used in the Tmux Plugin.
>
> Feel free to use them as a color palette if you prefer.
